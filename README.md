# Ensemble-model
Ensemble model using base classifier which uses supervised machine learning algorithm which can accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes

# Ensemble model used
● AdaBoost ensemble model with base estimator as Support Vector Classifier with
  number of instances of estimator equals to 50.
● Random forest ensemble model with base estimator as Decision tree classifier with
  10 Decision tree in the forest and the Entropy used as the parameter for information
  gain.
● Bagging ensemble model also uses Decision tree classifier as its base estimator with
  the number of instances as 50.
