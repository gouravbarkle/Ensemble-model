# What is ensemble learning 
Ensemble learning is the process by which multiple models, such as classifiers or experts, are strategically generated and combined to solve a particular computational intelligence problem. Ensemble learning is primarily used to improve the (classification, prediction, function approximation, etc.)

# why use ensemble learning
We explicitly use ensemble learning to seek better predictive performance, such as lower error on regression or high accuracy for classification. â€¦ there is a way to improve model accuracy that is easier and more powerful than judicious algorithm selection: one can gather models into ensembles.

# Ensemble-model
Ensemble model using base classifier which uses supervised machine learning algorithm which can accurately predict whether or not the patients in the dataset have diabetes

# Ensemble model used

# AdaBoost ensemble model
  with base estimator as Support Vector Classifier with number of instances of estimator equals to 50.

# Random forest ensemble model
  with base estimator as Decision tree classifier with 10 Decision tree in the forest and the Entropy used as the parameter for information gain.
  
# Bagging ensemble model
  also uses Decision tree classifier as its base estimator with the number of instances as 50.
